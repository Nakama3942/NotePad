# NotePad
## Overview
A program for creating notes with simple and complex formatting.

### Prerequisites
One spring morning they approached me and said that there was one project for me. To do it, I needed to figure out how to generate (or just write) .doc files. It was then that I decided to Nobisat like my own notepad, which can export notes from a regular .txt file to a document. Initially, it was not supposed to differ in any way from the standard notebook in Windows, but then I decided to modify it... This is how this project turned out and I still have plans to finalize this project.

## Usage
Launch the program, create a note and then you can do everything with it that the program's functionality allows. It is intuitive and anyone who has ever worked with MS Word, LibreOffice, etc. will understand the program. The difference between this program and the above is that, unlike those word processors, my program is still a text editor, and the formatting is saved in HTML format and the notes have a standard .txt format. However, they can be exported to standard .doc or .odt formats with subsequent resaving in the word processor itself.

## Building
The program is written in Qt, so you need to open the project through Qt and build the program through this IDE. After building, place the required libraries in the same directory as the executable file. The program is assembled, you can use it.
